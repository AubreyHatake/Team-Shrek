DEPLOYED SITE LINK WILL GO HERE: 
For this site the user is able to view the weather conditions for the national parks that they are planing on going on.  

## User Story 
As an avid hiker, I want to use an application that tracks hiking trails and weather so that I can plan and prepare for my hikes more efficiently.

When I view the details of a hike, I want to see the current weather forecast for the day of the hike.

This should include information about temperature, precipitation, and wind conditions so that I can dress appropriately and plan for any potential weather-related issues.

Overall, I want an app that combines the convenience of concert tracking with the practicality of weather forecasting, so that I can enjoy my hiking experience to the fullest.
